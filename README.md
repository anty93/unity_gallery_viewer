# unity_gallery_viewer
Gallery downloader and viewer made in Unity 2017.3.1f1. Implemented with Flickr API but can be easily extended to any other image hosting website API. Implements unity UI, i.e. Scroll View. Contains 3 screens: splash, menu and gallery view.

Example Flickr gallery IDs for testing:
- 72157692788097771
- 72157691209937521
- 72157692638888135
- 72157689485704142

If you don't put anything into the "max gallery size" input field it'll default to 10 photos.

'Settings' button in the main menu isn't implemented so clicking it won't have any effect.
